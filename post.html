            <p><b>Posted on:</b> 12th October, 2022</p>
            <p>My father was an administrative law judge. Monday through Friday,
                he’d rise at 5AM and drive to the train station. From there,
                he’d travel to San Francisco, catch a bus and arrive at his office.

                Dad would repeat the journey at the end of each work day.
                He typically arrived back home around 6PM, except for those
                times when he fell asleep on the train and missed his stop.

                We lived in a three bedroom home in the hills of Los Gatos,
                California. We had a view of silicon valley. When I was a boy,
                the dot com era hadn’t begun yet.

                Dad made a good living as an administrative law judge,
                and while we weren’t financially wealthy, we were comfortable.
                As the years passed, Santa Clara County evolved into the tech
                hub it is today. More and more “McMansion” homes started popping
                up around us, as the newfound wealth of Silicon Valley grew.

                It wasn’t long before our quiet town of Los Gatos changed. BMW’s,
                Mercedes Ferrari’s and other expensive cars zipped around town.
                Michelin rated restaurants emerged to cater to the new glitterati
                of Silicon Valley.

                Meanwhile, Dad continued to drive around town in his old, beat up Ford
                Ranger truck. “There’s nothing wrong with wealth,” Dad used to tell me,
                “But for many, they lose themselves in the process. It’s not wealth that
                defines you…it’s character.”

                Of course, as a cocky teenager, my retort was, “Well, I’d rather be a wealthy
                guy with character than a poor guy with character.” Dad smiled and said,
                “Sure, but the funny thing is, the most content people I meet are often not wealthy.”

                For example, one of my Dad’s favorite people was Corey, the local paver
                who repaired the neighborhood roadways. Dad used to hire him for odd
                jobs and invite him over for lunch and iced tea.


                They’d talk about history and life. “Corey is more down to earth and
                authentic than most of the people he works for,” Dad used to say.
                Dad’s other favorite person was his barber, Pat, who I’ve written about here:

                Here It Is! Your Cartoon Guide to the Best Life Ever

                My Dad was an Administrative Law Judge and United States Marine
                Corps veteran. He was a no-nonsense kind of guy.
                medium.com
                My mother and father sometimes attended parties in our neighborhood,
                although Dad’s preference was to stay home with a good history book.
                He went to these soirées mostly for my Mom, who enjoyed socializing.

                Dad often observed that many of our wealthy neighbors didn’t seem
                very happy. Yes, they had huge homes and expensive cars, but s
                ome also had marital problems, alcohol issues, stress related
                health challenges, and more. Others, despite making a lot of
                money, spent it foolishly. “Half these folks are mortgaged to the hilt,” Dad would say.

                My father retired from the bench at the age of 79. He retired
                later in life because he enjoyed his work and the intellectual
                engagement it provided. When he retired, he owned his home and
                cars. He had a good pension, medical benefits, and even invested
                in excellent, long-term care policies for my mother and himself
                (policies we’d end up needing later in life).

                What I learned from my Dad is that money is helpful, but it doesn’t guarantee happiness.
